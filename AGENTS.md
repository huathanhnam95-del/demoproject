# Local Agent Notes

## Browser Testing Credentials

- For any browser testing plan or browser test execution that requires login, first read `C:\Cursor AI\.local\browser-test-credentials.md`.
- Use the admin account documented there unless the user explicitly says to use a different account.
- In plans, refer to that file path directly instead of inlining credentials.
- Treat that file as local-only secret material. Do not copy its contents into tracked files, commits, or audit docs unless the user explicitly asks for that.
